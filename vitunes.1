.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a curses-based music player and playlist manager for *nix whose goals are
a minimalistic appearance, strong vi-like bindings, and quick playlist
creation/management.
.Pp
It is not intended to be a feature-rich media player, but rather
a quick, vi-like media indexer and playlist manager that also happens to be
able to play the media it indexes (via
.Xr mplayer 1 ).
.Sh GETTING STARTED
.Nm
works by maintaining a database of tagged media files.  The database
.Sy MUST
be created and populated before
.Nm
can be run normally.  After that, files can be added, modified, or removed
from the database, and on the next invocation,
.Nm
will see the changes (additionally, the database can be re-loaded at runtime).
.Pp
.Bl -bullet
.It
All database management is done using "e-commands", which are always of the
form:
.Dl $ vitunes -e command-name [ parameters ... ]
This includes creating the initial database, adding, modifying, and removing
files from the database, and tagging files.  See the E-COMMANDS section below
for details.
.It
Once the database has been created,
.Nm
can be run normally with the following:
.Dl $ vitunes
All playlist management is done while
.Nm
is running normally.
.El
.Pp
To get started using
.Nm ,
you MUST do the following
.Bl -enum
.It
Create initial empty database with
.Dl $ vitunes -e init
.It
Add files to your database with
.Dl $ vitunes -e add ~/music/  /path/to/more/music/
.It
Then just start normally with
.Dl $ vitunes
.It
After that, more files or even URL's can be added to the database using the
various e-commands.  This can even occur while
.Nm
is running normally, and the new database can be re-loaded at runtime.
Otherwise, the changes will be noticed on the next run.
.El
.Pp
The default location for everything
.Nm
uses is:
.Bl -column "item" "location" -offset indent
.It Li Configuration File: Ta
.Pa ~/.vitunes/vitunes.conf
.It Li Database File: Ta
.Pa ~/.vitunes/vitunes.db
.It Li Playlist Directory: Ta
.Pa ~/.vitunes/playlists/
.It Li Media Player: Ta
.Pa /usr/local/bin/mplayer
.El
.Pp
Please note that all files added to the database are stored using their
absolute pathname, as obtained from
.Xr realpath 3 .
If you move any of your media files around after adding them to the database,
you will want to remove them from the database and then re-add them.
.Sh DOCUMENTATION
Documentation is divided into the following sections.  They are, in order,
.Bl -enum -compact

CONFIGURATION FILE
.El
.Sh COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl d Ar database-file
Specifies the database containing all known media files and their meta
information that
.Nm
should use.  If you're using this option in conjunction with an e-command,
this option
.Sy MUST
be specified before the e-command.
.Pp
The default location is
.Pa ~/.vitunes/vitunes.db .
.It Fl f Ar config-file
Specifies the path of the configuration file
.Nm
should load.  See the section about the configuration file for information
on what the configuration can contain.
.Pp
The default location is
.Pa ~/.vitunes/vitunes.conf .
.It Fl p Ar playlist-dir
Specifies the directory containing all of the playlists
.Nm
will load and use.  Any new playlists created while running
.Nm
will be created here.
.Pp
The default location is
.Pa ~/.vitunes/playlists/ .
.It Fl m Ar media-player-path
Specifies the path to the media player to use.  Currently only
.Xr mplayer 1
is supported.
.Pp
The default location is
.Pa /usr/local/bin/mplayer .
.It Fl e Ar command Cm options
Execute one of the available e-commands to manipulate the database that
.Nm
uses.  See the section below titled E-COMMANDS for more information.
.Sh E-COMMANDS
Below is a brief summary of each e-command available in
.Nm .
Complete documentation for each e-command can be obtained by using:
.Dl $ vitunes -e help command-name
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It vitunes Ar -e init
Create the necessary database file and playlist directory used by
.Nm .
This command only needs to be run once, when
.Nm
is first run.  If either of these already exist, they remain unchanged.
.It vitunes Ar -e add path1 [ path2 ... ]
This command takes any number of files/directories as parameters.  Each file
provided is scanned for meta-information, specifically: artist, album, title,
track number, year, comment, and play-length.
.Xr TagLib 3
is used for all meta-extraction, so any meta-data-format
.Xr TagLib 3
supports (most) is supported by
.Nm .
Directories are searched recursively.  Each file encountered with meta
information is added to the database.
.It vitunes Ar -e addurl http://some-url
This command is used to add non-files (things like URL's for Internet radio
stations) to the database, where the meta-information cannot be determined
automatically..  It can also be used to update the meta-info of an existing
URL in the database.  After executing, you are prompted to enter all of
your own information.
.It vitunes Ar -e update [-s]
Load the existing database and check each file to see if its meta-information
has been updated, or if the file has been removed.  The database is updated
accordingly.
.It vitunes Ar -e check [-rsd] file1 [file2 ...]
Check an individual file to see its meta information and whether or not
it's in the database.
.It vitunes Ar -e rm [-f] file/URL
Remove a file/URL from the database.
.It vitunes Ar -e rmfile [-f] file/URL
Alias for the "rm" e-command.
.It vitunes Ar -e tag [options] file1 [file2 ...]
Add/modify the meta-information tags of raw files.  There are many options to
this e-command.  See the help page for more information:
.Dl $ vitunes -e help tag
.It vitunes Ar -e flush [-t time-format]
Dump the contents of the database to stdout in an easy-to-parse format.
.El
.Pp
For the complete documentation for each of the above e-commands, use
.Dl $ vitunes -e help command-name
.Sh THE DISPLAY
When run normally as just
.Nm ,
the default display will show 4 windows.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It player
This window occupies the top row of the display.  It contains information about
the currently playing song (if any) and the current play mode.
.It command/status
This window occupies the bottom row of the display.  It behaves very similar to
the command/status window in
.Xr vi 1 .
.It library
This window occupies the left-side of the screen, and by default is only 20
characters wide.  It shows each playlist that
.Nm
was able to load from the playlist directory, and two additional
pseudo-playlists which are always shown: the LIBRARY, which is a list of all
files/URLs in the database, and FILTER, which is where the results of any
.Ic :filter ...
command are temporarily stored.  Note that playlists with unsaved changes
appear bold.
.It playlist
This window is to the right of the library window and occupies most of the
display.  It shows the contents of whichever playlist has currently been
selected in the library window.
.El
.Sh KEYBINDINGS
The following is only a partial listing of the keybindings that
.Nm
supports.  Only those keybindings that are different from
.Xr vi 1
(or specific to
.Nm )
appear here.  See the website for a complete listing of supported
keybindings.
.Pp
Note that for keybindings, '^' denotes 'CONTROL + '.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It ENTER
In the library window, this loads the currently selected playlist.
In the playlist window, this begins playing the currently selected file.
.It TAB
In the library window, this switches focus to the playlist window.
In the playlist window, this switches focus to the library window.
.It z / ^p
Pause playback of the currently playing file, if any.
.It s
Stop playback.
.It f / b
Seek forwards/backwards 10 seconds in the playback of the currently playing
file.  If a number N is entered before hand (e.g.
.Ic 5f
is typed), then playback will seek N * 10 seconds forwards/backwards.
.It F / B
Seek forwards/backwards 1 minute in the playback of the currently playing
file.  If a number N is entered before hand (e.g.
.Ic 5F
is typed), then playback will seek N minutes forwards/backwards.
.It m
In the playlist window, this will show/hide the full filename and meta-information
for the currently selected file.
.El
.Pp
.Sh RUN-TIME COMMANDS
Below is an alphabetical listing of all run-time commands supported by
.Nm .
.Pp
All commands are entered by typing ':' followed by the command name and any
parameters (just like in
.Xr vi 1 ).
.Pp
Note that abbreviations are also supported.  That is, entering any non-ambiguous
abbreviation of a command name will also execute the command.
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It :color Cm item=fg,bg
Change the color of the given item to fg-colored text on a bg-colored
background.  Available items are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Fl -compact
.It tildas
The tildas in empty rows
.It bars
The bars dividing the windows
.It errors
Error messages in the status window
.It messages
Informational messages in the status window
.It status
The normal status window
.It player
Player window
.It library
Library window
.It playlist
Playlist window
.It playing
Currently playing row in both library and playlist windows
.It artist
The artist column in the playlist window
.It album
The album column in the playlist window
.It title
The title column in the playlist window
.It track
The track column in the playlist window
.It year
The year column in the playlist window
.It genre
The genre column in the playlist window
.It comment
The comment column in the playlist window
.It length
The play-length column in the playlist window
.El
.Pp
Available colors for fg and bg are: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, and cyan. 
.Pp
256 color support is coming.
.It :display Cm display-description
The display command is used to change which columns are displayed in the
playlist window, their order, their width, and their alignment. The format of
the display-description is a comma separated list of:
.Ic [-]<field-name>.<size>  .
Valid field-names are: artist, album, title, track, year, genre, comment, and
length.  The size field indicates the number of columns.  If the field-name
is preceded with a '-', the field will be right-aligned.  As an example, the
command:
.Pp
.Ic :display title.10,artist.20,-track.4
.Pp
would only show the title, artist, and track fields, in that order, where the
title field is 10 columns wide, the artist field is 20 columns wide, and the
track field is 4 columns wide and right-aligned.
.Pp
The default display can be restored with:
.Pp
.Ic :display reset
.Pp
The current display description can be seen with:
.Pp
.Ic :display show
.Pp
.It :filter[!] Cm token [ token2 ... ]
The filter command is used to filter out all songs from the currently viewed
playlist that do not match (or do match) the provided list of tokens.  A song
matches the list of tokens if each token appears somewhere in the song's
meta-information or filename.
.Pp
If ":filter" is used, all records NOT matching the list of tokens are
removed from the current playlist.  If ":filter!" is used, all records that DO
match the list of tokens are removed from the current playlist.
.Pp
The list of tokens is simply any list of strings, each possibly preceded with
an exclamation point.  If a token is preceded with an exclamation point, it
will only match a song if it does NOT appear anywhere in the song's
meta-information or filename.
.Pp
For example, the following:
.Pp
.Ic :filter nine nails
.Pp
would match all songs that contained both "nine" and "nails", and remove all
other songs from the current playlist.  However,
.Pp
.Ic :filter! nine nails
.Pp
would remove all songs that DO contain both "nine" and "nails."
.Pp
The query:
.Pp
.Ic :filter nine !nails
.Pp
would match all songs that contain "nine" and NOT "nails".  All other songs
would be removed from the current playlist.
.It :mode Cm [ linear | loop | random ]
Set the current playmode to one of the three available options.  The options
are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It linear
Songs are played in the playing playlist in order until the end is reached.
.It loop
Like linear, but when the end of the playlist is reached, playback continues
at the top of the playlist.
.It random
Songs are chosen at random from the playing playlist.
.El
.It :new Cm [ name ]
Create a new, empty playlist.  If a
.Cm name
is provided, the new playlist will be named accordingly, unless a playlist
with that name already exists.  If no name is provided, the default is
"untitled".
.It :q[!]
Quit
.Nm .
If there are playlists with unsaved changes, then you are notified of such and
prevented from quitting.  You can forcefully quit if '!' is provided, and any
unsaved changes to any playlists will be lost.  Note that playlists with
unsaved changes appear bold in the library window.
.It :reload Cm [ db | conf ]
The reload command is used to reload either the database or configuration
file while
.Nm
is running.  Handy if you update your database using an e-command while
also running
.Nm .
.It :set Cm property=value
The set command is used to set various properties within vitunes. The
following properties are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It lhide=<bool>
Valid values for
.Cm bool
are 'true' and 'false'.  If set to true, the library window will be hidden
(disappear) when it does not have focus.
.It lwidth=<number>
Set the width of the library window to
.Cm number
columns wide.  Note that the number provided must be greater than 0 and less
than the width of the terminal.
.It match-fname=<bool>
Valid values for
.Cm bool
are 'true' and 'false'.  When searching or filtering a playlist, normally
the filenames are also included in the matching algorithm. This can sometimes
be undesirable, particularly if, for example, all of your music/media reside
in a directory named "media" and you're trying to search for a file with the
word "media" in the title.  To disable this behavior, set match-fnames to
false.
.It save-sorts=<bool>
Valid values for
.Cm bool
are 'true' and 'false'.  Most operations that change a playlist (such as
paste/cut) set the 'needs-saving' flag on the playlist, such that you are
prompted on exiting vitunes that there is a playlist with unsaved changes.
By default, sorting a playlist does not do this.  To change this behavior,
and be prompted to save sorts on exit, set this option to 'true'.
.El
.It :sort Cm sort-description
Sort the currently viewing playlist using the given sort description.
A sort description is a comma separated list of:
.Pa [-]<field-name> ,
where the dash '-', if present, indicates that the field should be sorted
descending.  As an example, the following command:
.Pp
.Ic :sort artist,-album,title
.Pp
would sort all records in the current playlist by artist (ascending) first,
then album-name descending, then title.
.Pp
Valid field-names are: artist, album, title, track, year, genre, comment,
and length.
.Pp
Note that while most operations on playlists set the "needs-saving" flag
(so you are prompted when quiting
.Nm
that the playlist has unsaved changes), sorting a playlist does not do this.
This is intentional.  If you wish this behavior to be changed, see the
"save-sorts" option for the
.Ic set
command.
.It :w[!] Cm [name]
Save the currently viewing playlist.  If a
.Cm name
is provided, then the playlist will be saved with this new name.  If, however,
a playlist already exists with that name, then you will be prevented from saving
with that name unless '!' is provided, in which case the existing playlist with
that name will be deleted.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
The default configuration file loaded by
.Nm
is
.Pa ~/.vitunes/vitunes.conf ,
and can be overridden with the
.Cm -f
switch.  The format of this file is relatively straight-forward.  Each line
may be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
A comment, which starts with a '#'
.It
An empty line
.It
One of the commands from the
.Sy COMMANDS
section above.
.El
.Pp
That's it.  As such, review the list of commands above.
.Pp
An example configuration file that would setup some hideous DOS-like colors
is:
.Bd -literal
   # setup colors
   color bars=white,blue
   color player=yellow,blue
   color library=green,blue
   color playlist=white,blue
   color status=red,blue

   # format for playlist window
   display artist.20,album.20,title.20,track.4,year.4

   # show most recent work of an artist first in library window
   sort artist,-year

   # make library window 20 columns wide and hide when not active
   set lwidth=20
   set lhide=true
