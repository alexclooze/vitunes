.Sh NAME
.Nm vitunes-flush
.Nd output the contents of the vitunes database to stdout
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vitunes -e flush
.Op Fl t Ar time-format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command simply outputs the meta-information for all files in the
.Xr vitunes 1
database to
.Xr stdout 4 ,
in a fairly easy to read (but very easy to parse/grep through) format.
.Pp
The format used for representing the times a file was added and last
modified can be set using the
.Fl t Ar time-format
parameter, where
.Ar time-format
is any string acceptable by
.Xr strftime 3 .
.Pp
The output format is a simple comma-separated-value (CSV) one, where
most fields (any that can contain spaces/commas) are within double
quotes.  The first line contains the field names, and those fields that
are quoted are also quoted in this header row.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To perform a simple dump of the datebase, use:
.Dl $ vitunes -e flush
.Pp
To see which files were last updated this month:
.Dl $ vitunes -e flush -t "%M %Y" | grep "January 2010"
