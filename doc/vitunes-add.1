.Sh NAME
.Nm vitunes-add
.Nd add files to the vitunes database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vitunes -e add Ar /path/to/music Op Ar /path/to/more/music ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The add command is used to add files to the database used by
.Nm vitunes .
For every file/directory provided as a parameter,
.Nm
will scan that file or directory (recursively) searching for media files
that contain any meta information.  Any such files found are added to
the database that was created after running
.Xr vitunes-init 1 .
.Pp
If any files scanned are already in the database they will be re-scanned
and any changes will be updated.  Files that are scanned are not moved,
copied, or modifieid in any way.
.Pp
The information
.Nm
stores for each file includes:
.Bl -column "Really long string" "Really long string" -offset indent
.It Li "Filename" Ta "Track Number"
.It Li "Artist Name" Ta "Year"
.It Li "Album Name" Ta "Genre"
.It Li "Song or Video title" Ta "Play Length in seconds"
.El
.Pp
The filename stored is the absolute pathname obtained from
.Xr realpath 3
and serves as the key-field within the database.
.Pp
All meta data is extracted using
.Xr TagLib 3 .
.Pp
If any file encountered has no meta information, it is not added to the
database.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To add a single file to the database:
.Dl $ vitunes -e add  /path/to/music.mp3
.Pp
To search directories recursively and add all files contained:
.Dl $ vitunes -e add  ~/music  /usr/local/share/music
