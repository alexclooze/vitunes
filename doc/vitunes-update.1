.Dt VITUNES-UPDATE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vitunes-update
.Nd update all files in the vitunes database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vitunes -e update
.Op Fl fs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command loads the existing
.Xr vitunes 1
database and for each file listed, the file is checked to see if it has
been removed or modified since it was added to the database or last
updated.  If the file has been removed, it will be removed from the
database.  If the file has been modified, it's meta information will be
extracted again and the database will be updated.
.Pp
Note that if there are errors while checking any file, the error will be
reported but such files, and their meta information, will remain in the
database.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl f
Force the update of meta information of all files, even if their
modification times haven't changed.
.It Fl s
When present, files that are skipped because they have not been modified
will also be reported to
.Xr stdout 4 .
Normally, only files that are updated are reported.
.El
Anytime you remove/modify media files already in the
.Xr vitunes 1
database, you should run this command.
.Sh NOTES
Any files/URLs added to the database using the
.Xr vitunes-addurl 1
e-command will not be checked/updated in any way, for obvious reasons.
.Sh EXAMPLES
To scan all files in the
.Xr vitunes 1
database for updates, simply use:
.Dl $ vitunes -e update
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vitunes 1 ,
.Xr vitunes-add 1 .

.Nm vitunes
works, see the
.Sx GETTING STARTED
section in
