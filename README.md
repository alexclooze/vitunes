no-fluff media player & indexer

vitunes is a curses-based music player and playlist manager whose goals are: a
minimalistic appearance, strong vi-like bindings, and quick playlist
creation/management. vitunes does not strive to be a feature-rich media player,
but rather a quick, vi-like media indexer and playlist manager, that just
happens to be able to play the music it indexes.
